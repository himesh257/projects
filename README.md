Making a trading bot efficient enough to trade for the user

<h3>Requirement List</h3>

1. Get data from Yahoo Finance by simple webscraping (NOTE: if the website changes its format, meaning if any of the tags get changed, it will not give you right data. The solution for that will be to create a 'watch dog' that checks for the changes and modifies the code accordingly)</br>
  1. It needs to fetch data every minute (subject to change), so that required trade can happen</br></br>
2. Come up with a simple but effective trading strategy</br>
  1. Make sure that not more than certain amount of money is being used to trade</br>
  2. Keep looking at the changes to select which stock to buy or sell</br>
  3. Try to make it such that no loss ever occures</br></br>
3. Use Robinhood to trade stocks!</br>
